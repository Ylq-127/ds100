    "Here are some ideas for improving your model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Finding better features based on the email text. Some example features are:\n",
    "    1. Number of characters in the subject / body\n",
    "    1. Number of words in the subject / body\n",
    "    1. Use of punctuation (e.g., how many '!' were there?)\n",
    "    1. Number / percentage of capital letters \n",
    "    1. Whether the email is a reply to an earlier email or a forwarded email\n",
    "1. Finding better words to use as features. Which words are the best at distinguishing emails? This requires digging into the email text itself. \n",
    "1. Better data processing. For example, many emails contain HTML as well as text. You can consider extracting out the text from the HTML to help you find better words. Or, you can match HTML tags themselves, or even some combination of the two.\n",
    "1. Model selection. You can adjust parameters of your model (e.g. the regularization parameter) to achieve higher accuracy. Recall that you should use cross-validation to do feature and model selection properly! Otherwise, you will likely overfit to your training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may use whatever method you prefer in order to create features. However, **you are only allowed to train logistic regression models and their regularized forms**. This means no random forest, k-nearest-neighbors, neural nets, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not give you a code skeleton to do this, so feel free to create as many cells as you need in order to tackle this task. However, answering questions 7, 8, and 9 should help guide you.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** *You should use the **test data** to evaluate your model and get a better sense of how it will perform on the Kaggle evaluation.*\n",

    "\n",
    "We can trade off between precision and recall. In most cases we won't be able to get both perfect precision (i.e. no false positives) and recall (i.e. no false negatives), so we have to compromise. For example, in the case of cancer screenings, false negatives are comparatively worse than false positives — a false negative means that a patient might not discover a disease until it's too late to treat, while a false positive means that a patient will probably have to take another screening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that logistic regression calculates the probability that an example belongs to a certain class. Then, to classify an example we say that an email is spam if our classifier gives it $\\ge 0.5$ probability of being spam. However, *we can adjust that cutoff*: we can say that an email is spam only if our classifier gives it $\\ge 0.7$ probability of being spam, for example. This is how we can trade off false positives and false negatives.\n",

In the cell below, [plot a precision-recall curve](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_precision_recall.html#plot-the-precision-recall-curve) for your final classifier (the one you use to make predictions for Kaggle)."
